# Boilerplate 
- [TypeScript][typescript] [5.3][typescript-5-3]
- [ESM][esm]
- [ESLint][eslint] with some initial rules recommendation
- [Jest][jest] for fast unit testing and code coverage
- Type definitions for Node.js and Jest
- [Prettier][prettier] to enforce consistent code style
- NPM [scripts](#available-scripts) for common operations
- [EditorConfig][editorconfig] for consistent coding style
- Reproducible environments thanks to [Volta][volta]
- Example configuration for [GitHub Actions][gh-actions]
- Simple example of TypeScript code and unit test

## Getting Started

This project is intended to be used with the latest Active LTS release of [Node.js][nodejs].

### Use as a repository template

To start, just click the **[Use template][repo-template-action]** link (or the green button). Start adding your code in the `src` and unit tests in the `__tests__` directories.

### Clone repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jsynowiec/node-typescript-boilerplate
cd node-typescript-boilerplate
npm install
```

### Download latest release

unzip node-typescript-boilerplate.zip && rm node-typescript-boilerplate.zip
```

## Available Scripts

- `clean` - remove coverage data, Jest cache and transpiled files,
- `prebuild` - lint source files and tests before building,

## Additional Information

### Why include Volta

[Volta][volta]â€™s toolchain always keeps track of where you are, it makes sure the tools you use always respect the settings of the project youâ€™re working on. This means you donâ€™t have to worry about changing the state of your installed software when switching between projects. For example, it's [used by engineers at LinkedIn][volta-tomdale] to standardize tools and have reproducible development environments.

I recommend to [install][volta-getting-started] Volta and use it to manage your project's toolchain.

### ES Modules

This template uses native [ESM][esm]. Make sure to read [this][nodejs-esm], and [this][ts47-esm] first.

If your project requires CommonJS, you will have to [convert to ESM][sindresorhus-esm].

Please do not open issues for questions regarding CommonJS or ESM on this repo.
